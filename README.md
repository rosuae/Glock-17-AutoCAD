## Future Work & To-Do

* **Refining the internal mechanism:** The internal components (e.g., slide, firing pin, recoil system) are already modeled, but the mechanism is not yet functional. Further work is needed to ensure proper alignment, movement, and interaction between parts.
* **Adding spiral rifling:** Implement rifling inside the barrel to provide the bullet with increased velocity and rotational stability upon firing.
* **Testing tolerances:** Test all tolerances and clearances for a realistic assembly simulation.
* **(Optional) Ballistic Simulation:** Simulate ballistic behavior using physics software (e.g., Fusion 360, SolidWorks Motion, or similar).
